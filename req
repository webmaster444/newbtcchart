the slider is like any other slider... grab it and slide it left or right. moving it changes the selection which you can see the options in the various states  
the green/red sentiment circles represent positive and negative tweets. 
the gradient displays the percentage of each. it's a visual way to display the proportions of both positive and negative tweets. 
the size of the circle represents the amount of both positive and negative tweets in total. so the more positive and negative tweets... the larger the circle  

the bars represent total tweet volume which include positive, negative and also neutral tweets  when user switches the toggle on the upper right to tweet volume... the bars should "dissolve" up into the circles and the circles switch to blue to represent total tweet volume which include positive, negative and also neutral tweets  again the blue circles represent tweet volume... so larger size indicates larger amount of tweets in that period  i need to build you an api call for the chart
